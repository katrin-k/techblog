# PHP, my …

I recently started working on a project which is a php web app. No framework, all hand coded, also many old-school coding styles. Nonetheless, I'm looking into PHP right now. And I must say, it has potential. 

What?! What is she talking here? Potential? But it's super old. Most of the web is run on PHP! D'oh!

What I mean by potential is: The potential to become as acknowledged within the frontend community as JavaScript is nowadays. 

Remember all those conference talks about how quirky JS is? People have long looked down on JS and giggled "yeah, but it's only a scripting language". And yet people sat down and developed NodeJS which made all those wonderful node apps, JS frameworks, and the current web development workflows possible. Not to mention the work of the TC39 group, advancing JS as a programming language spec by spec. Even before NodeJS, people sat down and wrote desktop apps in JavaScript. Remember Adobe Air applications?

On the other side, I know many people, both from the backend side (i'm thinking of Java, C++ or Python) as well as from the frontend world (I guess almost everyone has their Wordpress story to share), and thus basically from all corners of the coding world rolling their eyes at PHP. I have my share in this, even though I never knew PHP (which makes it even worse) and only worked with it when I customized my Wordpress themes. At CSSclasses, we brief our coaches to not use "dismissive, pejorative opinions about any tool or language, not even PHP jokes". 

So I see quite a few similarities between JS and PHP when it comes to how people perceive it. And yet… there's this whole world of PHP. There's this number going round that presumably 70% of the world wide web is powered by PHP. 70 (seventy) percent. Plus, with PHP7 there's a further development in improving the language and thus a huge step toward making it future-proof.

Now, I have to say, I'm also only just starting to realize the differences and similarities and how both intertwine. PHP providing server-side rendered documents that still require JS for client-side interactivity. It's more of a backend than a frontend language (but then again: server-side JS anyone…). Both can be used for object-oriented as well as functional coding patterns (or processual, as they call it in the PHP world). Also, I don't really know about the actual quirks of PHP yet. But hey, also C and C++ have them.

Given the numbers of PHP usage, it's safe to say it'll not go away anytime soon. Especially not as long as JS website and blog frameworks will not provide content management systems that are simple to use for non-developers. But that's another story for another article.

Behaviour of the JS engines that base on the, let's call it "buest guess coercion"-principle (see this [talk by Kyle Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pL28CcEijU) for more). JS doesn't require you to make your code type-safe, yet JS engines use and depend on types, hence the JS engines have to guess them from the code people write. I guess, that's also one reason why  people have long looked down on JS and giggled "yeah, but it's only a scripting language". 

At concat '18, there was a talk about PHP. Unfortunately, it had a strong focus on the novelties in PHP7.2 and 7.3 and thus, to fully understand the impact of those novelties, requires the listeners to already know about the fundamental changes of PHP7. I don't know how many people in the audience are working with PHP in their daily lives, but given all the other talks were about JS, CSS and everything that comes to mind when you say "frontend", I would guess not too many. But I'm digressing.
