This Tuesday, i held a talk at the [VueJS Berlin meetup](https://vuejs.berlin/). The title is "A Quest For A Storyteller’s App - Adventures in the Lands of Electron and VueJs". You can find [the slides](https://die-katrin.eu/frontend-dev/slides-talk-storyteller/) on my website.

I'm currently working on an app that helps the dungeon master of my Dungeons & Dragons group to handle all the bits and pieces when he develops the adventures for our sessions. I chose Vue for the frontend and - as it turns out - also for the whole data persistance. Hence, i figured, what better place to talk about my adventures than a VueJS Meetup. 

This was not my actual first talk. I had a few lightning talks over the past two years. For quite a while now i'm thinking of giving tech talks. In 2018, i attended the Berlin event of the [global diversity CFP day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/). My attendances at the [CSSconf EU](https://2019.cssconf.eu/) and [JSconf EU](https://2019.jsconf.eu/) in the past two years were made possible by the heartwarming community lounge (thanks Michele and Vanessa!) where i once presented [CSSclasses](https://cssclass.es/) and the other time talked about [my gratitude](https://die-katrin.eu/frontend-dev/slides-talk-gratitude/) for the Berlin dev community. And, of course, at university, seminar presentations were a thing. Sometimes in front of 150 people. 

Yet, this talk feels special. I feel like this is my first real talk. For all these previous occasions, i found it quite easy to come up with content. Talking about myself or about a group i'm involved with, seems easy to fill. Also, 5 minutes is really a short time. And inbetween, i always struggled finding an interesting topic. A topic where i didn't feel like i wanna fall asleep over my own ideas. This sounds a little harsh, i know. Yet, this certain spark was missing all along. ✨

Over time, i did three things. 

Number one, i started writing down topic ideas (inspired by what Sarah Mei describes as her process in the [CFP Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHIHgauh000) video). 

Number two, i decided to take a step back and at first start this blog and get into writing again (strongly inspired by the current uprise of personal dev blogs and the "Today I Learned" section on [Stefan's blog](https://www.stefanjudis.com/).) This process strongly involves getting into the habit of taking knowledge pieces and shaping them into a, hopefully, coherent article. No matter how short or long. 

Finally number three, i started a coding diary alongside working on the Dungeons & Dragons app. This is, where all the writing went into in the past month. So far, it was a very valuable habit. It helps to keep track of things i needed to research first, of plans i made and the things that came inbetween, but also the reasons of why i changed priorities and challenges that popped up out of nowhere.

And this did the thing for me.
