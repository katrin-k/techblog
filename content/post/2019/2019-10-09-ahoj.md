Two weeks ago, i was at the [IndieWebCamp Nederland](https://indiewebcamp.nl/) in Amsterdam. This started of my beautiful Amsterdam Web Week.

I didn't really look into the focus of the IndieWebCamp. Barcamp-style sure. Something about open technologies. Maybe i could do some workshop-like session with CSS. I kinda expected several dozen, if not a few hundred attendees. And then i read again, read about the upper limit of 50 attendees, suppressed my upcoming social fears, reminded myself of the saying "you gotta go slightly outside your comfort zone to have a great experience", considered the alternative of walking around Amsterdam all on my own amongst heaps of tourists, signed up and had a beatiful weekend.

Number one effect of this weekend: i finally finished my new blog setup. So. Here we are. Ahoj!
